Skizophrenia vs Artificial Skizophrenia - Opinion

Historically the disease was an issue of mapping the quadrature nature of the
subjects reality with the psycological needs of the subject. Usually caused
by an event where control or power is taken away.

Recently (with exceptions, whispering tacktics probably) some people have tried
to start connecting imaginary associations through memes, and current cultural slang
with a covering mechanism of objective deniability or ongoing harrasment in order to
create something that resembles a process in the subjects mind. The use of technology
allows those who choose to try to create an artificially connected
skizophrenic reality to save the imaginary processes to computerized memory while still 
allowing the standard remote communication ability associated with a controlled group.
